# Final Project

**Code and demo due by 5:00pm on Friday, 6/15/2018**

In this course, a final programming project will take the place of formal exams to test your understanding of the material.  The final project will involve working with a team of 3-4 people to implement a substantial web app that utilizes all of the major components of the web application stack covered in this class.  Specifically, you and your teammates will write a web app that satisfies all of these requirements:

  * The app uses HTML and CSS to implement a well-designed client interface.
  * The app uses client-side JS to enable relevant user interactions with the client interface.
  * The app is served using a Node.js-based (or other approved) serving stack.
  * The app dynamically generates pages based on data stored in a back end data store, such as MongoDB.
  * The appÅfs client interface communicates with the appÅfs server to create, read, update, and/or delete content in the back end data store.

Within those boundaries, your team may write any kind of web app you want.  There are infinite possibilities, and I encourage you to be creative and to implement an application you find interesting or that solves a real problem for some set of potential users.  Below are some guidelines and logistics for the final project.
